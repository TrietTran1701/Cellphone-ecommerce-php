#### Developing Process
*Homepage:*

I apply HTML5 & CSS3 to make the website have a good-looking and user-friendly appearance. For the responsive design, I use css grid and bootstrap 4. In addition, by using Javascript, some effects of the website ( like scrolling or hovering ) can become smooth.


*Search bar:*

Applying ajax live-search technique, I can allow customers to input the name of a product into the search field. I query the database and display the product if it exists. Clicking on the productâ€™s name also takes users to its details page

*Product details page:*

This page displays the detailed description of the product, and shows the price. Users can increase or decrease the number of products they want to buy ( a jquery function will handle this part whenever a button is clicked ) and add products into cart.

*Cart page and checkout page:*

The main purpose of the cart page is to summarize the products added to the cart in the _SESSION[â€˜cartâ€™]. Users can also decide which products to remove, or increase the number of products they want to buy


*Login and sign up form:*

Customers who donâ€™t have an account can sign up, their email address and password after registration will be stored in the database, and the password will be hashed using MD5 for security purposes.

*Dashboard page overview*

The left-hand side of the page will show different categories for different purposes. When an admin ( or shop owner ) makes changes to any of these categories, it will also affect the database.
